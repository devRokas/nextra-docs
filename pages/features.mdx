# Features
Every API requires an input to narrow down and find information that needs to be returned to the end user. Different inputs enable and provide different implementation capabilities and value for our clients.

Features will be described in an input asset-based manner, eg. if a feature is described as password-based, the client needs to have access to a plaintext password to use it, etc.

## Password Based Lookups
Password Based Lookups

Password lookups enable clients to implement secured login, account creation, and password reset forms that detect the usage of exact leaked passwords.

The benefit of password-based searches is that it provides our clients access to our vast password database, containing billions of passwords. Our password database is updated frequently whenever we find new data, which is a clear competitive advantage compared to the password API provided by HIBP, which is widely used in the market.

## Email or Phone Based Password Lookups
While password-based lookups require specific user actions like login, password reset, or registration, the email or phone-based lookups enable "offline" or "Proactive Scanning".

Proactive userbase scanning allows our customers to find users who use exact or similar leaked passwords that make them vulnerable to credential-stuffing attacks.

This specific feature is even more powerful when combined with our “password fuzzing” or “similar password engine” technology, allowing customers to detect cases when users use modified leaked passwords.
